- Entire Chakra UI library loaded upfront (~2.5MB)
- No code splitting implemented
- Framer Motion adds 400KB without optimization

**Solution Priority**: HIGH

#### 2. Trending Stories Algorithm (450ms)
**Impact**: Slow user experience on popular feature
**Root Cause**:
- Real-time calculations across multiple tables
- Complex OR conditions with subqueries
- No caching or pre-computation

**Solution Priority**: HIGH

- Sequential scanning for content matches

**Solution Priority**: HIGH

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

#### 4. Story List Pagination
**Impact**: Performance degradation with large datasets
**Root Cause**:
- Offset-based pagination (OFFSET/LIMIT)
- Deep pagination becomes slower
- Count queries for pagination metadata

**Solution Priority**: MEDIUM
